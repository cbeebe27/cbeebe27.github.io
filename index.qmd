My academic and professional journey in finance, guided by my experience as a former NCAA hockey player, has shaped me into a dedicated and collaborative individual. Currently completing my BCom in Finance Honors at the University of Alberta, I'm deeply interested in trading, risk management, digital finance, and portfolio management.

This site contains related projects and files in the digital finance space, as well as using data analytics to solve different problems and present meaningful data-driven solutions. Topics touched on include:

Complex Data Analysis

Financial Market & Equity Analysis

Quantitative Trading Models

Energy Trading

Supply & Demand Models

Machine Learning

Predicative Analytics

Webscraping

I believe in continuous learning and applying my knowledge practically, and I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities to grow. As I complete more work and explore different topics, the documents will be uploaded to this site to grow my portfolio.
